This Java project contains 4 different classes: The Rank class represents the possible ranks of cards, 
the Suit class represents all the possible suits and the Card class represents the singular cards having some rank and some suit.
The project might be executed by running the CribCalculator class that will ask you to insert all the hand cards + the final starter card.
The program outputs the total points of the inserted Cribbage hand.
